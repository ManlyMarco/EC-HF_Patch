# HF Patch for EmotionCreators
An unofficial patch for Emotion Creators that installs the latest fan-made English translations and essential mods. It also fixes many common issues with the game. 

It will allow you to load all character cards and scenes and give you countless content creation and gameplay improvements while still keeping the original, uncluttered feel of the game. All content is tested and fixed (or removed) as needed before each update, providing a stable platform for further modding.

HF Patch does not contain the full game, paid expansions or any other pirated content. You have to [buy the game](https://dlsoft.dmm.co.jp/en/detail/illusion_0029/) and any expansions separately.

The base game (Emotion Creators), and by extension this patch are not suitable for minors. If you are under 18 years old you can not use this patch. The base game and this patch contain only characters of age 18 or higher. The creator of this patch is not responsible for creations of its users and prohibits any unlawful use of this software.

**Notes:**
- You can choose what mods you want, but for beginners it's recommended to leave the default settings.
- If you have installed a repack or are updating from an old patch, tell HF Patch to delete all old mods.

## What mods are included?
You can see a list of all included mods [here](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/EC-HF_Patch/blob/master/patch.iss#L24-L85) (lines that contain mods are highlighted, Description contains the mod name and version number).

## Important notes, please read
- This patch requires the full game to be already installed. Sideloader Modpack by Anon11 is included - it adds large amounts of new content and allows you to load most custom character cards. It is updated periodically here.
- If you have installed a previous HF Patch, a repack or separate mods it is recommended to remove ALL mods when prompted. This will prevent any potential mod conflicts or outdated mods causing problems.
- You can run this patch as many times as you want and nothing will break. All mods are optional to install, and most can be removed by running the patch again.
- It's recommended to install all content mods if you plan to download character cards - they might be required by some (or many) cards.
You can use this patch to fix many broken game/mod installs.
- Older versions of BepInEx will be automatically upgraded, and most botched installations should get fixed by running this patch. WARNING: If you have a very old BepInEx folder REMOVE it when prompted!
- Most mods are in plugin and sideloader form to avoid modifying game files. You can run HF Patch to remove them.
- Make sure you are installing to the correct directory! (the one with original exe files)
- Please leave the modders some positive feedback or help them in some other way! You can find their posts in links below and in the official HF discussion thread!
- There is no warranty on this patch or on any of the included mods. You are installing this patch at your own risk.

## How to build
Needs Visual Studio 2017 for the helper library and latest unicode Inno Setup compiler. All necessary mods have to be placed inside the Input directory to compile. Because of massive size, they are not included here.
